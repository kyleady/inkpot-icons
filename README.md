# Inkpot - Icons
A repository of ML generated icons for use with FoundryVTT's D&amp;D4e.

The current icons were generated by running https://github.com/borisdayma/dalle-mini locally using the prompts listed in `img_prompts.csv`.

This module contains no scripting and only contains icons available for use.

## Mixed Success

Generating icons that use common words have decent success

Generating icons from descriptions that are not easily understood create artistic patterns

The first round of generating icons also did not pin the icons to the context of D&D
